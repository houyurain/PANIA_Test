  <h1>Welcome to PANIA</h1>
  <p style="margin-top: 10px">Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disease which affects about 5.7 million Americans, and the number
    will grow to about 13.8 million by mid-century. AD and related dementia (ADRD) is a multifactorial and heterogeneous
    disorder that is driven by a constellation of genetic and environmental risk and protective factors. Currently,
    drug discovery research has not been translated into effective treatments, requiring the community explore novel and
    alternative treatment methods. Non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), such as sleep, diet，dietary supplements,
    aerobic exercise, aromatherapy, light therapy, and cognitive training are potentially modifiable and thus offer
    alternative opportunities for AD/ADRD prevention. Multimodal NPIs have also been reported to be effective in improving
    cognitive function. However, the synergetic effects of pharmacological interventions (PI) and NPI on ADRD are largely
    unexplored. Biomedical literature contains much evidence of PI and NPI effects on diseases (including AD/ADRD) and
    associated gene targets and pathways, allowing us to further understand and discover NPI candidates and their
    synergistic with PI for AD/ADRD. However, computational tools to mine literature and discover novel PI and NPI for
    AD/ADRD are still lacking. Using both population-based data (e.g., electronic health records (EHR), Optum Clinformatics®
    data, clinical trials) and animal studies to re-rank and validate our hypothesis discovered from literature would
    enable us to identify most plausible PI/NPI candidates and their combinations for AD/ADRD.</p></br>
  <p><b>Aim 1</b>. Constructing a comprehensive Pharmacological And Non-Pharmacological Interventions for Alzheimer’s Disease
    Knowledge Graph (PANIA-KG) from biomedical literature and other knowledge bases. We will leverage our prior work to
    compile and expand an NPI ontology and develop natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract NPI entities and
    relationships with other biomedical entities from literature. We will integrate the extracted knowledge from literature
    with other existing knowledge bases to construct a comprehensive knowledge graph, PANIA-KG. The deliverables are NLP
    tools to extract NPI knowledge from biomedical literature and a comprehensive PANIA-KG integrating multiple knowledge bases.</p></br>
  <p><b>Aim 2</b>. Detecting, understanding, and visualization of drug repurposing signals of PIs, NPIs, and their synergistical
    effects for AD/ADRD using the PANIA-KG. Using the PANIA-KG, we will develop novel neural network-based link prediction
    methods to predict and rank individual PI and NPI candidates as well as the synergistic pairs of those top-ranked PI and
    NPI candidates (including PI/PI, NPI/NPI and PI/NPI combinations) on AD/ADRD. We will utilize visualization to increase
    the explainability of the prediction models and understand the underlying mechanism of the synergistic effects. We will
    deliver signal prediction methods and ranked lists of PI and NPI candidates as well as their combinations on AD/ADRD.</p></br>
  <p><b>Aim 3</b>. Re-ranking and validating individual and synergistical drug repurposing signals using multimodal data sources
    and animal models. We will use clinical trials to re-rank and large-scale EHR data to in silico validate individual drug
    repurposing signals (PIs or NPIs) generated in Aim 2. Furthermore, we will use mouse models to in vivo validate top
    ranked pairs of PI and NPI candidates. We will deliver the informatics methods for mining clinical trials and EHR and
    validated individual and synergistic PIs and/or NPIs.</p><br>
  <p><b>Impact</b>: This is the first application to develop a translational informatics framework to aggregate, standardize and
    discover the effects of PI and NPI candidates on AD/ADRD using multi-modal data resources (i.e., biomedical literature,
    EHR, clinical trials) followed by mouse model validation. The successful completion of this project will deliver a
    comprehensive NPI knowledge graph, novel informatics approaches, ranked list of PI and NPI candidates, and validated
    synergistic intervention using multi-modal data sources. The generated approaches, PANIA-KG and ranked lists can
    further our clinical investigations and clinical trial design which focuses on synergistic effects of PIs and NPIs for
    AD/ADRD.</p>
